# My_Python_Script

Python Script
------------------

This script is written in Python, it uses Jenkins' API to get a list of jobs and their status from a given Jenkins instance. The status for each job will be stored in a sqlite database along with the time for when it was checked.
Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org/) is an open source continuous integration server.

Assumptions
------------------
For the sake of this solution, I assumed the Jenkinsâ€™ API is stored in the same directory as our Python script.
